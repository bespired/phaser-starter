# Phaser Starter
#### A bootstrap project to create games with Phaser + ES6 + Webpack.


## Features
- ESLINT with JavaScript Standard Style configuration
- Browsers are automatically updated as you change project files
- Webpack ready
- WebFont Loader


# Setup
You'll need to install a few things before you have a working copy of the project.

## 1. Clone this repo:

Navigate into your workspace directory.

Run:

```git clone https://github.com/bespired/phaser-starter.git```

## 2. Install node.js and npm:

https://nodejs.org/en/


## 3. Install dependencies:

Navigate to the cloned repo's directory.

Run:

```npm install```


## 4. Run the development server:

Run:

```npm run dev```

This will run a server so you can run the game in a browser. It will also start a watch process, so you can change the source and the process will recompile and refresh the browser automatically.

To run the game, open your browser and enter http://localhost:8080 into the address bar.
